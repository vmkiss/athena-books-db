Athena Books DB is a full stack web application that manages the daily operations of an independent bookstore. Users can keep track of the bookstore's products and sales by viewing, creating, editing, and deleting books, publishers, authors, and purchases.

Athena Books DB was created using Python's Flask framework and MySQL (MariaDB) database on the backend and Jinja, HTML, and CSS on the frontend.
